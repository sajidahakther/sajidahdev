            Software developer and designer based in London. Passionate about
            crafting beautiful digital experiences and building products that
            bring users value.

            I graduated from GoldsmÄ±ths, University of London studying Computer
            Science. Then joined a software company, designing websites,
            applications and digital editions for multiple media brands like GQ,
            Wired and Vogue. I have a love for learning and sharing knowledge.
            I've been teaching young kids coding for over two years. Leading
            workshops, bootcamps and classes at various schools across London. I
            believe coding is a powerful skill that enables us to bring any
            idea to life, encouraging us to become creators rather than
            consumers of the technology we use.
